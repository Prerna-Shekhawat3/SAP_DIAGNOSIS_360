# Diagnosis360

Diagnosis360 is an intelligent healthcare system that utilizes machine learning algorithms  to predict the likelihood of a patient developing various diseases based on their medical  history, lifestyle, and other relevant factors.The system uses various machine learning models to predict the probability of a patient  developing multiple diseases such as diabetes, Heart Disease, Breast Cancer disease, and  more. These predictions are based on various features such as age, gender, family history,  lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise habits, and more.

Multiple disease prediction system [Diagnosis360] is a project that aims to  predict various diseases based on the input symptoms of the patient. In this  project, several machine learning algorithms have been implemented to predict  the disease accurately. The algorithms used in this project include Decision Tree,  SVM, Logistic Regression.

 1) Decision Tree Algorithm for Symptom Checker
 2) Support Vector Machine for Diabetes and Parkinson's Disease Prediction   
 3) Heart Disease Prediction from Logistic Regression
 4) Breast Cancer Prediction using Neural Network
